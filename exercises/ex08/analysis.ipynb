    "\n",
    "Reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and **brainstorm modifications to the course that _create value_ beyond its current design**. When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each brainstormed idea should state a. the suggested change or addition, b. what the expected value created, and c. which specific stakeholders would benefit.  If helpful, expand on the following template \"The course should (state idea here) because it will (state value created here) for (insert stakeholders here).\"\n",

    "Example A: \"The course should use only examples from psychology experiments because it will be more relevant for students who are psychology majors.\"\n",

    "3. The course should use real-world examples within the coding lessons because many students in the class are not computer science majors so it would be more relevant for them. \n",

The course should offer an option to come to class in-person on Tuesdays in addition to Thursdays, where Tuesdays offer students a chance to work through the flipped classroom lessons in-person, because it would be useful for some students to hold themselves accountable to do the asynchronous lessons at a set time every week.

The data is found in the `survey.csv` file in this exercise directory. Each row represents an individual survey response.

One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it. Identifying new data sources can unlock improvements!"

    "2. Suggestion for how to collect data to support this idea in the future: There could be two additional questions asked: one towards non-computer science majors if they feel that having a section that is a bit more simplified and relevant to other majors would be useful. The other question could be towards computer science majors asking if they would like to go more in depth on concepts so that they are more prepared for COMP 210. The responses to these questions could be useful in analyzing if students would prefer splitting up the sections by major. "

When taught virtually, students often do not pay as much attention and concepts can be difficult to understand from just watching a video. Having the option to come to a physical classroom and follow along with the lesson in a group setting where there are peers or TAs around to ask questions during the lessonn can be useful. It can also provide students with a routine of coming to class every week. \n"

    "### Part 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "From my analysis, I can conclude that the data does not support my idea. Although I proposed having the option for Tuesdays to be synchronous, the data shows that most students do not feel strongly towards this. The average response, on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), is about a 3 for all three of the questions I analyzed. This indicates that on average, students have a strong opinion towards or against having class be synchronous entirely, but it is leaning towards keeping Tuesdays asynchronous. However, when considering the data calculated from the count function, it appears that for all three questions the most common responses were 1 and 2 (strongly disagree). This is emphasized in the bar chart that illustrates the responses to the all_sync question. Thus, it can be concluded that overall, students feel they would benefit more from having Tuesday as an asynchronous class period. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the negative impacts of implementing this change could be a strain of time and resources. TAs would have to come to the lecture hall and technical set up would be required in order to show the lesson on the screen. While the students may benefit, TAs and the instructor would have a greater workload added. A trade-off is that students may have easier access to help but they would lose flexibility in being able to work on the lessons at a time that is most convenient for them. Therefore, this plan may not be suitable for all students, especially those that would rather not have a set schedule but rather find times that work best with their routines. \n",
    "\n",
    "I agreee with the validity of the data analysis, as I think students' learning styles differ and having the opportunity to come to class one day of the week and work remotely another day might be a good balance. Instead, I could explore how students' performance actually changes with synchronous and asynchronous classes. Students could take an assessment after learning asynchronously and other students take the same assessment after learning the concepts synchronously. Overall performance can be compared to further test the potential of the idea I analyzed. Another option could be analyzing whether working asynchronously but at the regular class time improves performance in comparison to working asynchronously at flexible times that vary every week. \n",
